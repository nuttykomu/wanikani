# wanikani

> This repository contains UI prototypes (Vue components) for an upcoming project. I plan to develop an unofficial WaniKani client to further gamify the process of learning kanji. But since I do not have much knowledge about kanji or the WaniKani platform at the moment, project development will be deferred until later.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
